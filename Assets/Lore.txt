 70.000.000.000 land animals are killed every
   year to produce meat, dairy and eggs for
     human consumption,  with the excuse
      that "they need it". If only they
          knew how wrong they are...

Well, while their awakening time is yet to come,
   you must save as many innocents as you can.

       Oh! And watch out for the farmer.
     He does horrible things to peaceful
          livings... including you!
